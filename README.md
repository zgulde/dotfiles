# My Settings

This is a repository to back up all my config files so they are easily ported
across devices and accesible in case I lose a machine.

For those browsing, my `.bash_profile` just sets a few common settings, my
aliases and functions are in separate files. `plugins.txt` contains all the
plugins I use for my editors.

There's also a cool tutorial on rebinding your capslock key in the `capslock.md`
file.
